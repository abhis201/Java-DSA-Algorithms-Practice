## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Updated Project Structure

The `Practice_Projects` folder contains various subfolders and files for practicing Java concepts and algorithms. Below is an updated and detailed overview:

### Folder Structure

    - `LinkedList.java`: Implementation of a singly linked list with basic operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.
    - `Tree.java`: Implementation of tree data structures, potentially including binary trees or other variants.
    - `disjoint_sets.java`: Implementation of the union-find algorithm, useful for solving connectivity problems.
    - `fibonacci_heap.java`: Implementation of Fibonacci heaps, a priority queue structure with efficient merge operations.
    - `graph.java`: Implementation of graph data structures, including adjacency lists or matrices.
    - `hashtable.java`: Implementation of hash tables, showcasing collision resolution techniques.
    - `priority_queue_heap.java`: Implementation of a priority queue using a heap structure.
    - `queue.java`: Implementation of a basic queue with enqueue and dequeue operations.

- **OOPS/**
  - Contains object-oriented programming examples to demonstrate principles like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Key file:
    - `oops.java`: A comprehensive example covering OOP concepts in Java.

- **Problems/**
  - Contains solutions to various algorithmic problems, categorized by their nature. Key files include:
    - `binary_search.java`: Implementation of the binary search algorithm for sorted arrays.
    - `countword.java`: Program to count the frequency of words in a given text.
    - `flipmatrix.java`: Solution to a matrix manipulation problem.
    - `matchparenthesis.java`: Algorithm to check for balanced parentheses in an expression.
    - `maxprod.java`: Program to find the maximum product of two numbers in an array.
    - `mergeSort.java`: Implementation of the merge sort algorithm, a divide-and-conquer sorting technique.
    - `nbinary.java`: Solution to a problem involving binary number manipulations.
    - `paliindex.java`: Program to find the index of a character that makes a string non-palindromic.
    - `palindrome.java`: Algorithm to check if a string is a palindrome.
    - `pattern.java`: Program to generate and print specific patterns.
    - `sort.java`: General sorting algorithm implementations.
    - `vowel_consonants.java`: Program to count vowels and consonants in a string.
    - `SortingAlgorithmsPerformance.java`: Utility to compare the performance of various sorting algorithms.

  - **SortingComparison/**
    - Focuses on comparing sorting algorithms. Key files include:
      - `QuickSort.java`: Implementation of the QuickSort algorithm, a divide-and-conquer sorting technique.
      - `RadixSort1.java`: Implementation of a Radix Sort variant using stable counting sort as a subroutine.
      - `RadixSort2.java`: Another Radix Sort variant optimized for 32-bit integers.
      - `SortingComparison.java`: Utility to benchmark and compare sorting algorithms on arrays of varying sizes and digit lengths.
      - `Radix&Quicksort.pdf`: A document providing theoretical insights and comparisons between Radix Sort and QuickSort algorithms.

### Usage

1. Navigate to the desired folder to explore specific topics.
2. Compile and run Java files using your preferred IDE or command line tools.
   - Example for compiling and running a file:
     ```bash
     javac Data_Structures/LinkedList.java
     java Data_Structures.LinkedList
     ```
3. Refer to the `README.md` files in subfolders (if available) for detailed instructions and examples.
