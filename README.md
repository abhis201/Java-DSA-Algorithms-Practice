# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Workspace

This workspace has been reorganized with logical folder names for better structure and navigation.

## Folder Structure

### ðŸ“š **Java_Fundamentals**
Basic Java programming concepts and core language features:
- Comparator vs Comparable implementations
- Object-oriented programming basics
- Core Java syntax and patterns
- Compiled class files for reference

### ðŸ’» **Practice_Projects**
Structured practice problems and personal projects organized in a Maven-like structure:
- **`src/`**: Source code directory containing:
  - **`Data_Structures/`**: Comprehensive implementations of data structures
    - Basic Structures: LinkedList, Queue, Hash Tables
    - Tree Structures: Binary Trees, Priority Queue implementations
    - Advanced Structures: Disjoint Sets, Fibonacci Heap, Graphs
  - **`OOPS/`**: Object-oriented programming concepts and examples
  - **`Problems/`**: Algorithm problems and solutions
    - Binary search implementations
    - String manipulation problems
    - Array and matrix operations
    - Pattern matching algorithms
- **`bin/`**: Compiled class files
- **`lib/`**: External dependencies

### ðŸŽ“ **Course_Exercises**
Organized by programming concepts and difficulty:

#### **Java_Basics**
- Static vs Instance methods and variables
- Class design and object creation
- Basic Java syntax and conventions

#### **Object_Oriented_Programming**  
- Inheritance and polymorphism
- Abstract classes and interfaces
- Encapsulation principles
- Design patterns

#### **Advanced_Java**
- Optional class usage and null safety
- Lambda expressions and functional programming
- Stream API and modern Java features
- Exception handling patterns

#### **Collections_And_Generics**
- Generic type implementations
- Collection framework usage
- Custom data structure creation
- Type safety and parameterized types

## Getting Started

1. **For Learning**: Start with `Java_Fundamentals` and progress through `Course_Exercises`
2. **For Practice**: Use `Practice_Projects/src/` for personal implementations and algorithm practice
3. **For Data Structures**: Navigate to `Practice_Projects/src/Data_Structures/` for standard implementations
4. **For Problem Solving**: Check `Practice_Projects/src/Problems/` for algorithmic challenges

## Development Setup

- Each folder contains related files organized by topic and complexity
- Use VS Code workspace features for debugging and development
- Compiled `.class` files are kept with their source files for easy testing
- README files in sub-folders provide specific guidance where needed

## Notes
- **Organized by Purpose**: Each folder serves a specific learning or development goal
- **Maven-like Structure**: `Practice_Projects` follows standard Java project layout with `src/`, `bin/`, and `lib/` directories
- **Clean Separation**: Course exercises, fundamentals, and practice projects are clearly separated
- **Professional Layout**: Suitable for portfolio presentation and collaborative development
- **Compiled Classes**: `.class` files are organized in the `bin/` directory for easy testing and execution
